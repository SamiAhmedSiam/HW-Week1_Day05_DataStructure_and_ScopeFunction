# Kotlin Essentials (Data Structure /Scope Functions)
---
The Kotlin assignment has three components
- Practice with Scope Functions.
- Practice with Lists and Sets.
- Practice with Maps.

> Note: You must save your solution as `solution_part1.kt` for Part I, `solution_part2.kt` for Part II, and `solution_part3.kt` for Part III.

## Part I - with Scope Functions.
---
- Create a working exmaple withing 'Let'
- Create a working exmaple withing 'Run'  (Optional to do = Bonus!!)
- Create a working exmaple withing 'Also'  (Optional to do = Bonus!!)

## Part II - Practice with Lists and Sets.
---
- Create a list and access it and print it, then update or add elements to it
- Create a list and access out of its bounds, then manage the array errors safety with 3 different ways
- Create a list then add repetitive and unique elements to it, then convert it to set, then add new elements to it and print the set values

## Part III - Practice with Maps.
---
- Write an answer to this question: What are the cases that I need to use the map for??
- Answer: There are many cases, like: our national IDs' mapped to our names, our emails/numbers mapped to our usernames or a fridge filled with items/fruits mapped to number of instances.
- 
- What is the difference between immutable and read only variables?
- Answer: An "immutable" object is one that cannot be changed once created. If you look at the string manipulation routines you can see that all of them return a new, modified, string and leaves the original string unchanged, which means no one else will unexpectedly change it under supervision.
- whereas, "read-only" means the reference can't be changed, once set and that it can only be set during object construction.
- in short, we can rephrase: readonly is set on the reference to an object. Immutability is a property of the object itself.
- 
- Create a map of 20 elements of strings and doubles
